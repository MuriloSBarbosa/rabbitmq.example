# RabbitMQ Example with Spring Boot üêá

This repository contains an example implementation of a RabbitMQ producer using Java Spring Boot.

## Architecture

This project is divided into the following components:

- **Receiver**: Contains the logic to receive messages from RabbitMQ.
- **Sender**: Contains the logic to send messages to RabbitMQ.
- **BookDto**: Data Transfer Object (DTO) used to represent the movie data being sent.

All dependencies are managed by a `pom.xml` file.

## Running the Application

To run the application, use the following command:

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Make sure RabbitMQ is running and accessible. You can use Docker to run RabbitMQ:

```bash
docker compose up
```

## Scheduled Task

The `Sender` class contains a scheduled task that sends a random movie to RabbitMQ every 5 seconds.
The movie data is generated using JavaFaker.
